# Etch-A-Sketch-Project
In this project I was in charge of developing a "magic whiteboard" from HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT. We can modify the number of boxes to fill (so that our drawing is more or less detailed) with the color that we want or some palettes of a certain color but with a different hue each time we fill in a space. If your drawing does not convince you, you can erase the detail you want.  Hope you like!
